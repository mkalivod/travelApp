## Overview
A web app that allows users to input places they would like to travel to, and then match with other users who also want to go there!

Log in or create an account, and then click on places you want to travel to in your lifetime. Clicking on these locations will add them to your bucket list. When viewing your bucket list, click on a location to see if you have any mutual friends who also want to go there. If you do, then start arranging some travel plans! :airplane:
